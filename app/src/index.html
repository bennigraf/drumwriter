Type any sequence of characters ([A-Za-z]) in a line to 
create a loop. Fine-control that sequence by adding lines 
beginning with special control characters below the "main 
sequence". 

Hit `ctrl+Enter` to run the line set around the current 
cursor position (which could be as little as the current
line). `ctrl+.` stops playback.

Special characters:
 - " " (white space) is being ignored - use it to format/indent lines
 - # marks a comment (all characters following this will be ignored)
 - . is a break
 - | marks lines to be played simultaneously to the "main line"
 - = marks a line that's used to define the velocity of the notes of the line above
 	- - is the default velocity
	- ` is high velocity/"accent"
	- , is lower velocity
 - ❌ (abc) will play "abc" as triplets
 - @ allows one to set some 'settings':
    - ✅ `@bpm <number>` sets the current bpm

Special keys:
 - ❌ ctrl + arrow up/down: Jumps to previous/next lineset (starts playback if nothing's running)
 - ❌ Space: Start/Stop playpack
 - ❌ Tab: Hit repeatedly to tab in tempo
 - ❌ +/-: Increase/decrease bpm by 1
