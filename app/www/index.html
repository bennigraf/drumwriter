# marks a comment â€“ the line is being ignored

Type any sequence of characters in a line to create a loop.

Special characters for sequencing:
 - " " (white space) is being ignored - use it to format lines
 - . is a break
 - | marks lines to be played simultaneously
 - = marks a line that's used to define the velocity of the notes of the line above
 	- - (or nothing/white space) is the default velocity
	- ` is high velocity/"accent"
	- , is lower velocity
 - (abc) will play "abc" as triplets

Special keys:
 - Enter/Return: Jumps to the next line (starts playback if nothing's running)
 - Space: Start/Stop playpack
 - Tab: Hit repeatedly to tab in tempo
 - +/-: Increase/decrease bpm by 1
